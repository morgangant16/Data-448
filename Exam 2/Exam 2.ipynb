    "    \n",
    "2.In what scenarios, RandomSearchCV would be preferred instead of GridSearchCV? Be specific.\n",
    "    The only difference is that RSCV picks random combinations. You should use RSCV when you have big data sets or a lot of hyper parameters you are trying to tune.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3.How does stacking work?\n",
    "    Its splits the dataset into training and testing, trains base learners on the training dataset, applies the base learners on the testing to make predictions and then uses the predictions as inputs to the actual responses as outputs to train a higher-level learner. It’s important that the predictions from the base learners are not correlated with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.If you have trained three different models on the exact same training dataset, and they all achieve a 93% F1-score on the exact same dataset. Is there any chance that you can combine these three models to get better results? If so, how? If not, why? Be specific.\n",
    "    There is an ensemble method calling voting and it combines prediction of models by voting. You can combine the models and try the voting method but it’s not certain it will be able to improve the overall F1 score because of how similar the models are performing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5.If your XGBoost model overfits the data (probably because the number of boosted trees is large), what hyper-parameter you need to tune? Be specific.\n",
    "    n_estimators -->May improve performance\n",
    "    max_depth --> decreasing prevents over fitting\n",
    "    Gamma --> increasing prevents over fitting\n",
    "    Min_child_weight  Increasing prevents overfitting\n",
    "    \n",
    "6.Which of the following algorithm is NOT an ensemble learning algorithm?\n",
    "    a.Support Vector machine\n",
    "    \n",
    "7.How does XGBoost with random forest as base learner work? Be specific.\n",
    "    It runs when you tune the num_parallel_trees from its default variable. It allows you to choose the number of parallel trees \n",
    "    you want to run during each boosting round. Then the trees get combined to create a Random Forest for each round!\n",
    "    \n",
    "8.How do we select the best hyper-parameter combination for a given model?\n",
    "    b. Performance on the validation dataset\n",
    "    \n",
    "9.Picture\n",
    "    a.He should select 400 trees because we tune the training data set and that is the lowest number of trees that gives us the highest F-1 score.\n",
    "    b.The reason for the overfitting could be tuning factors like number of estimators and depth of tree. Have too many of each can cause the model to overfit, \n",
    "    but there are others as well that can be tuned. \n",
    "    \n",
    "10.What is the difference between homogeneous and heterogeneous ensembles? Be specific.\n",
    "    Heterogeneous ensemble methods have different algorithms for base learners and Homogeneous ensemble methods is where the same algorithms are used for all the base learners.\n",
    "    \n",
    "11.Random forest is an example of\n",
    "    d: a and c --> Homo and Bagging\n",
    "    \n",
    "12.A junior data scientist is working on building a classification framework that can help a small local credit union to identify fraudulent transactions. \n",
    "The data scientist collects a very small dataset with 100 observations, from which 4 observations are labelled as fraudulent, to start building and tuning the model. \n",
    "As part of the tuning process, the data scientist considers using the GridSearch function from scikit-learn with cv = 5. Explain why this approach is a good idea or not. Be specific.\n",
    "    This is not a good idea because when you create the splits, at least one of them won’t have a fraudulent transaction included. \n",
    "    What if all 4 are in the same one and the other 4 splits don’t have one? I don’t think this is a good approach to do when the number of \n",
    "    fraudulent transactions can’t be evenly split into the folds. \n",
    "    \n",
    "13.The typical hyper-parameters in a XGBoost model that data science practitioners tune are:\n",
    "    a.Max_depth because it causes more relationships to be created making the model more complex, Subsample because decreasing prevents overfitting \n",
    "        as with colsample_bytree and learning_rate.\n",
    "    b.n_estimators! By increasing it may improve results.\n",
    "    \n",
    "14.  In tree-based models such as random forest, gradient boosting, and XGBoost,\n",
    "how does a data scientist optimize the number of trees in a manually fashion? Be specific.\n",
    "    They can set up their desired model and start by running it with a small amount of trees (say 10-50). Use an appropriate performance measurement to evaluate performance. \n",
    "    Once you have a base performance, increase the number of trees until you hit a point where the performance no longer improves. \n",
    "    Many times, the optimal number of trees isn’t a clean number like 500, it could be 459, but getting to a number like 550 or \n",
    "    560 can still get you to a umber close to the best performance!\n",
    "    \n",
    "15.A Machine Learning Specialist is assigned to a team that is responsible for tuning an XGBoost model to ensure that it performs correctly on test data. \n",
    "However, when dealing with unknown data, this does not operate as planned. The following table summarizes the existing hyper-parameters:\n",
    "    a.Regression because the objective is the squared error!\n",
    "    b.There are 2000 estimators, and the depth is 30, both are very significant amounts!\n",
    "    \n",
    "16.How can overfitting and underfitting be addressed through hyper-parameter tuning in random forest? That is, what hyper-parameters would you tune \n",
    "to address overfitting and underfitting in random forest? Be specific.\n",
    "    Most common parameters: n_estimators, min_samples_split, min_samples_leaf, max_depth. \n",
    "    n_estimators finding a good number of trees, so the model isn’t under or overfitting and getting a good performance overall.\n",
    "    min_samples_split helps prevent the model from branching out too much and following noise, it helps prevent overfitting.\n",
    "    mine_samples_leaf forces more observations to be at the leaf’s getting a bigger picture of the data, increasing will help over fitting.\n",
    "    max_depth to keep the model from being too complex and overfitting but deep enough so the important patterns are analyzed (not underfitting).\n"
